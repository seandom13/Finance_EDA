# Finance_EDA
In this project I focused on exploratory data analysis(EDA) of six bank stocks through the financial crisis. 
I used a csv file that included all financial information from 2006-2016. I read the data into the notebook 
using pandas read_csv. I then continued pandas to create various dataframes to explore different aspects of the 
stocks. I used seaborn, matplotlib, plotly and cufflinks to visualize all my data including heatmaps, line 
graphs, clustermaps, pair plots, distrbution plots, and interactive plots. I visualized times series, simple
moving average, Bollinger Band, and correlations in this exploratory data analysis. You will find the key 
observations throughout the jupyter notebook.
